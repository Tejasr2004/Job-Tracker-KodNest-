A smart, frontend-only Job Notification Tracker designed to simplify the job application process with intelligent matching, status tracking, and daily digest simulations.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
-   **Intelligent Match Scoring**: Automatically scores jobs (0-100%) based on your preferences (Role, Location, Mode, Experience, Skills).
-   **Daily Digest**: Simulates a personalized daily email update with your top job matches.
-   **Job Status Tracking**: Track your applications with statuses like "Applied", "Rejected", or "Selected".
-   **Persistence**: All data is saved locally in your browser, so you never lose your progress.

### Premium UI/UX
-   **Dashboard**: Clean, card-based layout with sorting and filtering.
-   **Dark/Light Mode**: (If applicable, or just mention the clean design).
-   **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop.

### Developer Tools
-   **Test Checklist**: A built-in 10-point checklist (`/jt/07-test`) to verify system health.
-   **Proof of Work**: A dedicated page (`/j/proof`) to generate a standardized submission summary.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
-   **CSS3**: Custom styling with CSS Variables for theming.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: specialized logic for routing, state management, and match scoring.
-   **LocalStorage**: client-side data persistence.
